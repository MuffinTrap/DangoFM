### TODO

- Class for Voice
- Swapback list for channel voices : enables skipping unused voices
- Separate buffer for each channel : enables channel specific effects
- Define different types for Seconds, Samples and Ticks
- Create Clock class

- Copy Multipliers from OPL
- Enum for Intervals

- No need to save NoteOff time. If note is off, duration becomes time since it happened
- How to make an envelope that does not have sustain?

- Feedback?
	0.1 step is too much
	0.01?
/ add Feedback to sin() output?  **SEEMS TO BE CORRECT**

- Make operator levels exponential
- Make feedback level exponential

## Adjust with video
Modulation index: around 10?
